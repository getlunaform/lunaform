  description: "This is a RESTful server for managing Terraform plan and apply jobs\
    \ and the auditing of actions to approve those apply jobs.\nThe inspiration for\
    \ this project is the AWS CloudFormation API's. The intention is to implement\
    \ a locking mechanism\nnot only for the terraform state, but for the plan and\
    \ apply of terraform modules. Once a `module` plan starts, it\nis instantiated\
    \ as a `stack` within the nomencalture of `terraform-server`.\n"
